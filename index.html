      <h2>Developer in progress</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">I have worked two years as a PR and SEO manager in Berlin. After learning a lot about how to communicate about a website and its services, I realised that what really thrilled me was to actually know how the product works. I am now attending a computer programming bootcamp and have so much fun learning so much every day.</p>
